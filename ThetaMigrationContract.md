## Guide on Migration of ERC-20 THETA Tokens to TNT20 Tokens on Native Theta Mainet Network

Some Theta supporters still hold their ERC20 Theta tokens from years ago. These old Theta tokens were created on the Ethereum network and played an important role **in the early days** of Theta. However, as we transition to our independent Theta Mainnet Blockchain, these tokens are **no longer compatible** with our platform and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Users have started migrating Theta tokens from the old ERC20 standard to the new TNT20 tokens on the Theta Mainnet. All Theta holders can swap their old Ethereum Theta tokens for the new native tokens on the Theta Mainnet using **the migration contract**.

## How to Use Migration Contract

The migration smart contract provides a secure and efficient way to migrate your old ERC20 THETA tokens** without connecting to external platforms**. It is specifically designed for migration purpose. As an **open-source** Ethereum contract, its code is fully transparent and publicly accessible for review, ensuring trust and accountability. 

In brief, after ERC20 THETA tokens are sent to the migration contract, these tokens will be **burned** and permanently removed from the Ethereum blockchain. Users performing the migration **will receive new THETA** native mainnet tokens in the TNT20 standard.

Using the migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on the Ethereum Blockchain. This means that every user who wants to perform the migration **needs to have ETH** in their wallet. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee when sending THETA tokens to the migration 
contract.

The migration can be done from any wallet you typically use to access THETA tokens. **All wallets support the migration process.**

To perform the migration, send your old THETA tokens to the migration smart contract address `0xD92378A8150312a05F55A8397D0099b55F223f4b`

For the amount, choose to send **entire balance** of your THETA tokens. The migration contract will **wait for the full balance** to arrive before initiating the migration process. This is done to optimize for high Ethereum gas fees, which are partially covered by Theta Labs. Depending on the network usage, it may take **2–10 minutes** to process the migration.

Your wallet will **automatically recognize** the new THETA tokens, which will be credited to your wallet. This is made possible by the **wallet linkage** functionality in the migration contract, which leverages standard private key cryptography. The new THETA tokens are securely tied to the **same private key and seed phrase** that you used for your previous ERC-20 THETA tokens, although the public address will look different. 

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration. Now you can be sure you hold **the latest** THETA tokens in the TNT20 standard.
